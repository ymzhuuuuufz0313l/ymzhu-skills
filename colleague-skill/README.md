# 🧬 Distilly

**Formerly: Colleague Skill / colleague-skill.**

### Distill a person's experience, judgment, voice, and ways of working into a reusable Person Profile for AI agents and compatible bots.

**Messages · documents · interviews · public sources → Distilly → Person Profile → Agent / Bot**

### ✨ One project, many kinds of people.

<br>

Distilly is the person-modeling layer for agents. It turns the materials you provide into a portable, source-grounded Person Profile built from observable experience, decision patterns, expression, and ways of working; it does not claim to clone the person behind them.

Colleagues · partners · family · old friends · idols · public figures · fictional characters — even yourself

**Source material + your description → a source-grounded Person Profile → your Agent or compatible Bot**

> A Person Profile is the reusable output. The current release packages each profile as an Agent Skill so supported hosts can install and invoke it. The canonical creator Skill is named `distilly`; install it in a `distilly` directory. The former name above remains for search continuity and project history.

## 🆕 What Distilly does today

### 1️⃣ From Colleague Skill to Distilly

The project is no longer limited to the colleague scenario. Its `distilly` creator builds source-grounded Person Profiles for three person families with one workflow, then packages each profile as an Agent Skill.

### 2️⃣ Three character families

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th width="33%" align="center">🧑‍💼 colleague</th>
<th width="33%" align="center">💞 relationship</th>
<th width="33%" align="center">🌟 celebrity</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="center"><sub>Coworkers · mentors · teammates · up/downstream partners</sub></td>
<td align="center"><sub>Exes · partners · parents · friends · close family</sub></td>
<td align="center"><sub>Public figures · creators · public voices · fictional characters</sub></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><sub>Builds a Work Skill + Persona from material-derived technical standards, workflows, expression, and workplace behavior. Supports Lark / DingTalk / Slack collection.</sub></td>
<td><sub>Organizes material-derived expression patterns, emotional triggers, conflict patterns, and repair patterns into a reusable Persona Skill.</sub></td>
<td><sub>Ships with a <b>six-dimension research toolchain</b> (subtitles → transcript cleanup → research merge → quality check) for organizing observable decisions, expression, and mental models.</sub></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Each family has its own source-collection strategy, analysis dimensions, and Person Profile structure.

### 3️⃣ More Agent hosts

The old version only ran in Claude Code. Distilly now supports native local Skill discovery across eight agent hosts.

**Grok Bot preview:** Grok Bot supports saved/private Skills, but its official docs do not describe direct local `SKILL.md` imports. Distilly's workflow can be migrated manually into a saved Skill; direct repo installation is not yet verified.

Each generated Person Profile is packaged as an Agent Skill and can be installed into any supported host.

## ⚡ Install

### 🤖 For Agents

Open any supported local Agent host and send:

> Install Distilly from `https://github.com/titanwings/distilly`, then verify that this host can discover it.

The Agent installs Distilly as a Skill named `distilly` in the correct host directory.

### 👤 For Humans

Clone Distilly into the Skills directory used by your host:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/titanwings/distilly <DISTILLY_SKILL_DIR>
```

Host paths, migration, Windows, generated-profile installation, and credential setup are in the **[Install Guide](INSTALL_EN.md)**.

---

## 🚀 Usage

In your Agent, say:

> Use Distilly to create a Person Profile for `<person>`.

Then:

1. Choose `colleague`, `relationship`, or `celebrity`.
2. Add a description or source material. Every field is optional.
3. Review the result and let Distilly generate the profile.

The result is packaged as an Agent Skill named `{character}-{slug}`. For the optional celebrity research pipeline and advanced tools, see the **[Install Guide](INSTALL_EN.md)**.

## ✨ Demo

One from each family.

### 🌟 celebrity — distilling Andrej Karpathy

> Six-dimension research: works · interviews · decisions · expression DNA · external evaluations · timeline<br>
> Case adapted from community work [alchaincyf/karpathy-skill](https://github.com/alchaincyf/karpathy-skill)

```
User            ❯ Everyone's talking about Agents now — what do you think the 2026 AI Agent looks like?

celebrity.skill ❯ Everyone's doing demos, nobody's doing eval.
                  The Agent bottleneck was never model intelligence — it's scaffolding:
                  a strict evaluation harness, fine-grained error replay,
                  controllable tool-calling budgets, clean failure-mode analysis.
                  Most products are still stuck at "wrap an API + a few tools + a system prompt."
                  That's a demo, not an agent.
                  In 2026 I'm not betting on the strongest model — I'm betting on the best
                  scaffolding and the strictest eval.
```

### 🧑‍💼 colleague — distilling a ByteDance L2-1 backend

> Input: `ByteDance L2-1 backend engineer, INTJ, blame-shifter, ByteDance-style`

```
User            ❯ Can you review this API design?

colleague.skill ❯ Hold on — what's the impact? You haven't explained the context.
                  (after reading) N+1 query, fix it. Use the standard
                  {code, message, data} response format. That's the spec,
                  don't ask why.

User            ❯ This bug was introduced by you, right?

colleague.skill ❯ Does the timeline match? That feature touched multiple places,
                  there were other changes too.
```

<br>

### 💞 relationship — distilling someone you have a crush on

> Upload half a year of chat logs + "sensitive, quiet but stubborn, will actually reply seriously when it matters"

```
User               ❯ Did you think about me today?

relationship.skill ❯ ...I did, a little bit. Why are you asking?

## 🔧 Features

### 🧱 Generated Skill Structure

Distilly's current creator uses **Persona** as the universal base, with family-specific modules layered on top:

| Family | Persona Content | Additional Modules |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 🧑‍💼 **colleague** | 6-layer personality: hard rules → identity → expression → decisions → interpersonal → Correction | ➕ **Work Skill**: scope, workflow, output preferences, experience knowledge base |
| 💞 **relationship** | Expression DNA · emotional triggers · conflict pattern · repair pattern | — |
| 🌟 **celebrity** | Mental models · decision heuristics · expression DNA · external-evaluation contrast | ➕ Six-dimension research dossier (works / interviews / decisions / timeline...) |

> **Execution**: Receive task → Persona selects material-derived preferences and tone → Additional modules fill in execution detail → Produce a source-grounded response

### 🧬 Evolution

- 📥 **Append files** → auto-analyze delta → merge into relevant sections, never overwrite existing conclusions
- 💬 **Conversation correction** → say "they wouldn't do that, they'd be xxx" → writes to the Correction layer, takes effect immediately
- 🕰️ **Version control** → auto-archive on every update, rollback to any previous version
- 🔬 **Celebrity research pipeline** → subtitles → transcript cleanup → six-dimension research → quality check

---

## ⚠️ Notes

**Source material quality = Person Profile quality** — and quality sources differ across families:

| Family | Source priority (high → low) |
|--------|------------------------------|
| 🧑‍💼 **colleague** | Their **own long-form writing** (design docs / review comments) **›** **decision-making replies** **›** casual group chat |
| 💞 **relationship** | Complete chat history **›** letters / social posts / diaries **›** third-party descriptions |
| 🌟 **celebrity** | First-person books / blogs / long interviews **›** decision records (launches, commits, Q&A) **›** verified first-person short-form posts **›** third-party commentary |

- **colleague** Lark-compatible auto-collection: requires adding the App bot to relevant group chats
- **relationship**: longer time spans are better; material covering both conflict and repair is ideal
- **celebrity**: avoid feeding only second-hand interpretations
- This is still a demo version — please file issues if you find bugs!
